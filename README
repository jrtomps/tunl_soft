Added auto-indexing to the flat_tree.  The id field 
is now ignored and can be left out of the ro_config.xml file.  The 
EventNumber and RunNumber are set properly in the flat_tree.
There is also a realtime option (-rt) which will keep the file open for processing continuously.  This is still under development.

1) 
To compile the software package set "RELEASE_MY" environment variable, example:

     setenv RELEASE_MY /scratch/tunl_soft

2) 
source $RELASE_MY/scripts/release.tcsh
this will setup environment variables needed for the successful compilation.
Sourcing release.tcsh will also amend your PATH.

3) 
to run the "coda2root" parser 

   - set "RELEASE_CODA_FILE_PATH", example:

     	 			   setenv RELEASE_CODA_FILE_PATH /scratch/data/my_experiment_name

!!!NOTE!!!: the name of the last directory in the path, i.e, "my_experiment_name" will be also regarded
as the prefix for the coda file names. Meaning the coda2root parser will look for a file called 
"my_experiment_name_XXX" (where 'XXX' is the run number) in /scratch/data/my_experiment_name.

   - set "RELEASE_ROOT_FILE_PATH", example:
			           
                                   setenv RELEASE_ROOT_FILE_PATH /my_desired_path/for_output_root_files

NOTE: the output of coda2root will be in /my_desired_path/for_output_root_files and will look like
run_XXX_tree.root where 'XXX' is the run number.

4) 
type 'coda2root XXX' and be happy.

5)
make sure your RELEASE_CONFIG_PATH environment variable points to the desired configuration file, example:
setenv RELEASE_CONFIG_PATH /scratch/tunl_soft/source/programs/coda2root/config/ro_config.xml


If you need a bash version of the above instructions, write your own or try to bribe/blackmail someone who 
will do it for you.
